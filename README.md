# 3-Color LED Module with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a 3-color LED module using an Arduino Nano. The LED module consists of three colors: red, green, and blue. By controlling the digital output pins of the Arduino, you can switch between the different colors, allowing for a wide range of color combinations and visual effects.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **3-Color LED Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **LED Module Connections:**
   - Connect the red pin of the LED module to digital pin 2 (redPin) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the green pin of the LED module to digital pin 3 (greenPin) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the blue pin of the LED module to digital pin 4 (bluePin) on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the 3-color LED module to the Arduino Nano as described above.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LED module cycling through different colors (red, green, and blue), with each color being displayed for 1 second alternately.

#### Applications

- **Color Mixing:** Experiment with different combinations of red, green, and blue to create various colors and visual effects.
- **Decoration:** Use the LED module to add colorful illumination to your projects, displays, or decorations.

#### Notes

- Feel free to modify the code to create custom color patterns or add additional functionalities based on your requirements.
- Ensure correct wiring and connections to prevent damage to the Arduino Nano or the LED module.
